The Registrar's web site leaves something to be desired when all you want is a quick look at a few courses. Fortunately, much registrar data is freely available, so it's possible to make a private version that might be more satisfactory at least along this dimension. This assignment is a somewhat open-ended exercise in using Ajax technology to make a highly responsive alternative.

My own quick and dirty version is the unRegistrar, which you can use as a starting point. It includes minimal Ajax functionality as described in class, and simple tooltip code adapted from lixlpixel.org. You will soon see that although it is responsive and easy to use, it's also dumb and the code is sleazy. Your task is to make it somewhat smarter and add some new features while preserving its speed, simplicity and convenience for ad hoc queries like "what QR classes start at 1:30 on Monday and Wednesday?" (The version on my web page does a bit more than the code provided; you can replicate features of my web-page version if they appeal.)
